This user-friendly command-line tool empowers programmers of all skill levels to efficiently manage their Git repositories. With an intuitive menu and clear instructions, Git Lit simplifies essential Git tasks like:

- Initializing repositories (coming soon!)
- Adding and committing changes (coming soon!)
- Discarding unwanted changes (coming soon!)
- Viewing Git status (coming soon!)
- Branch management (coming soon!)

<!-- ## Visual Helper
